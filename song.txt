Today is too late
How long do we have to wait
Oh no, I think she knows
That's why I can't let go
I feel this burning inside
A feeling that no one should know
This could be so good again
I'd wait here till then
But not with this
So now I'll leave with

We're mad with regret
Memories that we'll both forget
So far it's been so hard
To cover up these scars
I see this falling apart
It's easy to just let it go
No luck between us both
So I keep waiting
But not with this
So now I'll leave with
